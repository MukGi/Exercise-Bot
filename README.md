<h1>Coach-Fit Chatbot Update</h1>
<h1>Coach-Fit Chatbot</h1>

<h2>Update (13/03/2025) <h2>
<ul>
  <li>Database on a limited number of muscle groups was added</li>
  <li>The program responds to 'greeting' & 'muscle_groups' prompts.</li>
  <li>The program has default response if it does not match with greeting & muscle group prompts.</li>
  <li>Send button is functional</li>
 <li>Disclaimer for the seeking of professional advice is added for every exercise response</li>
  
  
</ul>

<h2>Improvements (13/03/2025) <h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unfinished Database on a limited number of muscle groups, so I can add more exercises for other muscle group</li>
  <li>NLTK is still yet to be used. NLTK should be implemented asap.</li>
  <li>Coach-Fit Logo is still yet to be added</li>
  <li>Send button is functional but it does not resemble the initial midfi, this could be changed </li>
  <li>User Input is aligned with Coach-Fit's response, this could be changed to have the user input to be aligned on the right just like in the midfi</li>
  <li>ChatBot does not seem to respond well to prompts with long sentences. E.G if you ask: "Hello Can I please have a workout routine or exercises for biceps?" It will respond by greeting you . It seems to somehow process the 'Hello' first not the question</li>
  <li>DISCLAIMER can be coded to be added in the next lines after the Exercise recommendations</li>
  <li>ran out of ideas lol... </li>
</ul>
